The Macedonian Monument is on the campus of the United States Naval Academy, across the street from Mahan Hall,[1] at the end of Stribling Walk. 
The monument's sculpture is the figurehead of HMS Macedonian, captured by Stephen Decatur and the American frigate United States in the opening days of the War of 1812. 
Also known as Alexander the Great and the Figurehead of Hans Macedonian, the wooden sculpture dates to circa 1810. 
It came to the Academy in 1875.
