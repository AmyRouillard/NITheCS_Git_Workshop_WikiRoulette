The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), founded on 15 September 1883, is one of the largest non-governmental organisations in India engaged in conservation and biodiversity research.[1] 
It supports many research efforts through grants and publishes the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. 
Many prominent naturalists, including the ornithologists SÃ¡lim Ali and S. 
Dillon Ripley, have been associated with it.
